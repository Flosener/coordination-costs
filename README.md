# How to work on this project

## Branch Overview
As soon as the project is set up, the branch `workflow` will carry the most stable development version.

During development, we will work on different dedicated branches for each feature, which, upon completion, will be merged into `workflow`.

Once the first version of the project is stable enough and ready to deploy, we will move it to `main`.

## Development Workflow

- Create new branch from `workflow` (locally)
- Commit changes to remote branch
  - Use same name of local branch for remote branch on Github
- When ready, create pull request
  - Select people to review
  - Connect open issue to pull request: To do so, add the keyword `closes` to the PR description, followed by a `#` and the corresponding issue number,  e.g: `closes #5`
  - When every reviewer has given their approval, complete the PR.
  - Delete branch on GitHub 
  - Close pull request 
  - Delete branch locally
